## [Unreleased]

### Added
- One-click "Connect with Strava" OAuth flow — eliminates manual curl token exchange
- OAuth callback handler with CSRF protection via state nonce
- Automatic first sync after successful OAuth authorization
- "Test Connection" button on Settings page — verifies credentials and shows athlete name
- Connection Status card on Settings page with token expiry date and status indicator
- Token health admin notice on plugin pages when credentials are missing or expired
- Specific API error descriptions (401, 403, 429, 5xx) replacing generic "API returned status" messages
- `offset` argument for GraphQL `stravaActivities` query for pagination
- `speedUnit` GraphQL field ("mph" or "km/h") matching the distance unit setting
- Speed fields (`averageSpeed`, `maxSpeed`) now converted to match distance unit (mph or km/h)

- `wpgraphql_strava_activities_to_fetch` filter (default 200, max 200)
- Copy-to-clipboard buttons on GraphQL query examples in Getting Started page
- Input validation: `first` clamped to 0-200, `offset` validated, `type` sanitized

- SVG route thumbnails in admin Activities list table (replaces checkmarks)
- Plugin Check (PCP) job in CI workflow

- Security CI job: `composer audit`, debug code detection, hardcoded secret scanning, unsafe PHP function detection
- PHPCS and PHPStan results uploaded to GitHub Code Scanning via SARIF
- Automated release workflow — code owners run `Release Version` from Actions tab (patch/minor/major)
- Dependency Review on PRs (fails on high-severity vulnerabilities)
